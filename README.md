Let's work through Project Euler in Ruby so we're not *completely* cack-handed in it

When I first had a crack at Project Euler, several years ago, it was in Python, and consisted of a bunch of messy scripts I probably ended up emailing back and forth from one place to another. I've barely started with the Ruby version, and it's already in source control with a module of helper functions and a test suite.

I like to think this is a sign I've grown as a person.
